This story, while attempting to establish a noir atmosphere, falls flat in its execution. The writing is overly descriptive and "tells" rather than "shows".  The characters are archetypes, not fully formed individuals.  Here's a breakdown of what needs serious work:

**1.  Show, Don't Tell:**

* **The writing is too descriptive.**  Instead of saying "Jake's face bore the marks of a failed dream," **show** us those marks. Describe a specific scar, a line of weariness, a haunted look in his eyes.  Don't tell us his eyes are clouded with "weary resignation."  **Show** us a specific moment where his eyes lose their spark.
* **Avoid clich√©s.**  "Flickering neon sign", "weary traveler", "faded dreams" are all overused tropes.  Find fresh language to evoke the atmosphere.  Instead of "the air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation," describe the specific scent of a particular cigarette brand, the stale air clinging to a dusty motel room, the weight of unspoken emotions that hang in the air. 
* **Don't tell us Red is a master manipulator.** Show us his techniques.  How does he use his words, his gaze, his body language to control people? Let us see him manipulate a situation, not just be told he's good at it.

**2. Characters Lack Depth:**

* **Characters are archetypes.** Jake is the naive young man, Red is the manipulative mentor, Eve is the femme fatale.  Give them real motivations, flaws, and desires. What makes them tick?  What are their histories?  What are their vulnerabilities?
* **Dialogue is clunky and exposition-heavy.**  Avoid lines like "I can teach you the art of the hustle," "You look like a man who's lost his way,"  or "This young man has a knack for it."  Instead, let the characters reveal their personalities through their interactions. Use dialogue to create conflict, tension, and reveal hidden truths.  

**3.  Narrative Structure:**

* **The story is predictable.**  The set-up is too formulaic. We know Jake will be tempted, Red will be the mentor, Eve will be the object of desire, and The Shadow will be the antagonist.  Subvert expectations.  Give us surprising twists and turns. 
* **The story lacks a clear conflict.**  What is Jake's real motivation beyond making money?  What are the stakes?  What is he fighting for?  What is he losing? The conflict needs to be more personal and impactful.

**Example of "Show Don't Tell" Revision:**

Instead of: "He'd arrived in Dry Gulch with nothing but a worn-out guitar and a suitcase full of disillusionment, seeking a fresh start, a place to escape the echoes of his failed musical aspirations."

Try: "The dusty bus coughed to a stop, spewing exhaust that hung heavy in the air. Jake stepped out, his faded guitar case scraping against the cracked pavement. He looked around, his face a canvas of disappointment. The once-bright paint on his guitar had chipped and faded, mirroring the shattered hope in his eyes."

**Example of Dialogue Improvement:**

Instead of: "What kind of help?" Jake asked, his voice barely a whisper.

Try: "Red's gaze held him captive.  Jake licked his lips, the taste of dust and fear lingering in his mouth. "What kind of help?" he whispered.  His voice was a mere echo of the confident young man he once was."

**Overall, this story needs a serious rewrite.  Focus on showing us the world, the characters, and their inner struggles.  Use evocative language, create believable dialogue, and develop a compelling conflict.  Forget about telling us how to make money, and show us the true cost of ambition.**
